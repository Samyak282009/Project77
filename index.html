      Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code,
       is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS.
        Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets
         code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install
          extensions that add additional functionality. Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with
           a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python, C++, C, Rust and Fortran.
            It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js web applications that run on the Blink
             layout engine. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component (codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps 
             (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team Services).
          Out of the box, Visual Studio Code includes basic support for most common programming languages. 
          This basic support includes syntax highlighting, bracket matching, code folding, and configurable snippets.
          Visual Studio Code also ships with IntelliSense for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, and HTML, as well as
           debugging support for Node.js. Support for additional languages can be provided by freely 
            extensions on the VS Code Marketplace.
